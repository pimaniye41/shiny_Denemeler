# Sampling statistics and visualizations with Shiny

This project's idea is to help students, who are just like me, understand sampling statistics easily with interactive tools and visualizations. My expected finish time is by the end of Summer 2023. 

## Roadmap for the project
#### Distributions of Sample Statistics
- Sampling from a Population
- Sample Means
- Sample Proportions
